# Assignment
Develop and implement algorithm for parallelization of matrix multiplication for 2 large row x column vectors or vice versa with the following conditions:
- a) Shared memory parallelization - *parallel_a.c* program
- b) Distributed memory paralelization - *parallel_b.c* program

Along with the implementation of 2 above mentioned tasks, simple serial multiplication without parallelization was also implemented inside *serial.c* program in order to compare results and emphasize the impact of parallelization.

For more details about developed algorithms a) and b) checkout the presentation.
